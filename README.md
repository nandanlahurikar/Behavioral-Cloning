## Behavioral Cloning Project: Navigation of car in a Simulator

### Overwiew
  The aim of this project was to drive car autonomusly in a simulator, using Convolutonal Neural Network(CNN). The simulator is provided by udacity. To collect training data, I drove car manually in simulator using keybord. Used record option to store training images and corresponding stiring angles. Used this data to train our neural network.
